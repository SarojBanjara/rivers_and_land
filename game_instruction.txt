            Enter the number of rows and columns you want to have for a matrix.
            Only enter 0's or 1's
            Each 0 represents land, and each 1 represents part of a river.

            A river consists of any number of 1s that are either horizontally or vertically adjacent
            (but not diagonally adjacent). The number of adjacent 1s forming a river determine its
            size.

            If all entered sizes match then 'You are the winner.'
            If 60% of the inputs match with sizes in array of river sizes,you will get second position.
            If none of your input matches, you lose the game and you will have a option to play again.
